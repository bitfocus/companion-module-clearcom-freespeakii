## Clear-Com FreeSpeak II

Controls and monitors a Clear-Com **FreeSpeak II base station** (FSII-BASE-II) through the same interface the
CCM web page uses. You get live beltpack tallies, battery/signal status, call signals, remote mic kill, role
changes, base port routing and GPOs.

### Setup

1. Enter the **base IP address or hostname**. No username or password is needed (see _Security_ below).
2. Leave **Device ID** at `1` unless your base is part of a linked system.

### Targeting beltpacks by role

Actions and feedbacks target **roles** (e.g. "Camera 5"), not physical packs. A button follows whoever is using
the role, even when crew swap packs. Each dropdown also lists physical packs (`Pack FSII-BP-12345`) for spares
with no meaningful role.

You can select several roles at once. You can also type names into **Or by name** (comma separated role labels,
pack labels or pack ids). This field accepts variables and expressions.

### Actions

| Action                       | Notes                                                          |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Call signal: role / pack     | Pulse, on, off or toggle. Optional call text                   |
| Call signal: whole channel   | Calls every pack and 2W/4W port on a partyline                 |
| Remote mic kill: role / pack | Turns off the talk keys on the selected packs                  |
| Remote mic kill: all packs   | Must be enabled in the connection settings                     |
| Change pack role             | _Learn_ fills in the pack's current role                       |
| Route base port to channel   | Join, leave or toggle a partyline for a 2W, 4W or station port |
| Call signal: base port       | Call signal out of a 2W/4W port                                |
| Set base GPO                 | Force on/off, toggle, or release back to automatic             |

Reboot, reset, firmware and configuration editing are deliberately not included.

### Feedbacks

- Role / pack is talking (any key or a specific key), is online, has a call active, battery or link quality below
  a threshold. Each one takes any mix of roles and packs, and is true if any of them match. Stack them on a button
  (e.g. grey = offline via inverted "is online", orange = low battery, amber = calling, red = talking).
- Channel: someone is talking / calling. Base port is routed to a channel.
- Any online pack below a battery threshold. Any expected role has no pack online.
- GPI / GPO state, connected to the base.

### Variables

Variables use numeric ids, so renaming a role in CCM does not break your buttons.

- Per role (`r<roleId>_...`): `label`, `pack`, `online`, `battery`, `time_left`, `rssi`, `link`, `talking`
  (e.g. `1,R` = key A and reply), `antenna`
- Per channel (`ch<connectionId>_...`): `label`, `talkers`, `talk_count`, `members`
- System: `base_state`, `base_uptime`, `base_version`, `packs_online`, `packs_total`, `low_battery_list`,
  `offline_list`, `last_caller`, `last_call_channel`, `last_call_time`, `gpi<n>`, `gpo<n>`

### Security

The base's control interface has no authentication. Anyone who can reach it on port 80 can do everything this
module does: kill mics, send call signals, change roles and reroute ports. Keep the base on an isolated
production network, and only run Companion on machines that are allowed to control it.

"Remote mic kill: all packs" is off by default, so a stray button press cannot mute the whole crew. Turn it on in
the connection settings if you need it.
